  <div data-role="collapsible">
  <h1>BS</h1>
  <p>The Electrical Engineering degree is based on the HEC/PEC approved curriculum. In the first year the students learn the fundamentals of Electrical Engineering supported by essential mathematics and physics courses. These courses are followed by breadth courses which introduce students to different specialties in Electrical Engineering. In the senior year students choose a specialization stream and study advanced courses. Currently specializations are being offered in three areas, Telecommunication Engineering, and Computer Engineering. In the highly competitive job market a young engineer is not only required to be knowledgeable in technical areas but is also expected to have excellent communication and managerial skills and an appreciation of modern day economics to design and implement a cost effective engineering solution. Students are offered courses in communication skills, engineering management and economics to prepare them for challenging environments. Social Science electives and courses in Professional Ethics contribute in enhancing the soft skills and help prepare a well rounded personality. The course work is supported by state of the art engineering labs. During four years, students work in twelve different labs where they perform experiments using state of the art instruments, equipment and simulation software.</p>
